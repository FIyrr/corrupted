## Introduction
Always thought that upgrading something should always have multiple alternatives?
Well, i completely agree!
This is why this datapack adds Corrupted Diamond items, an upgrade to them that you can choose alternatively to netherite!

# Corrupted Diamonds
Corrupted Diamonds are, well... the corrupted form of diamonds which can be found in ancient cities' chests!
They are used to upgrade diamond items to their corrupted form which you can do by surrounding them with 4 corrupted diamonds in a regular crafting table!

# Corrupted Tools
## Corrupted Diamond Sword
The Corrupted Diamond Sword deals just as much damage as a normal diamond sword but has an special ability:
Sonic Boom!
This ability allows you to cast a weaker variant of the warden's sonic boom attack dealing damage to everything that it hits at the cost of 250 experience points!
Holding this sword will also disable your offhand slot till you select another (This needs to be done to properly detect rightclicks and can NOT be disabled)

## Corrupted Diamond Pickaxe
Using this Pickaxe to mine blocks you have chance to infest and break nearby stone-type blocks!
(Supported blocks are: Stone, Diorite, Deepslate, Smooth Basalt, Netherrack, Tuff, Calcite, Granite, Andesite, Infested Stone, Infested Deeplate and Sandstone)

## Corrupted Diamond Axe
Hitting a mob with this Axe might call the warden to pull a nearby mob in the ground by one block and therefore slow it down!

## Corrupted Diamond Shovel
Breaking blocks with this shovel has the chance to reward sculk related items!

## Corrupted Diamond Hoe
The ability of the Corrupted Diamond Hoe causes you to gain xp when harvesting crops. 
The amount of gained xp can reach from just a few points to multiple levels!

# Corrupted Diamond Armor

Corrupted Armor in it's weakest form only has the same durability as leather armor, despite being way more resistant. 
You can gain strenght and also fix the durability issue by collecting experience orbs and thus increasing your level. These bonuses have 2 stages, one at 100 experience levels and one at 250!

## 100 XP-Levels
After you reach the 100th XP-Level your armor will become completely unbreakable

## 250 XP-Levels
Having and XP-Level higher or equal to 250 will grant you Resistance I and Strength II

*Both of these bonuses only last while you have the full set equipped and are reverted once you no longer have enough experience points. Additionally to that, wearing the full set will also drain 20 experience points per second*

# Upgrading To Netherite
You can't upgrade corrupted items to netherite and trying to do so anyways will cause them to explode in a cloud of xp, gold and some netherite scraps!

# Advancements
The pack adds 5 new Advancements to the game, all of them can be found in the "Adventure Tab" after achieving the vanilla  "It Spreads!" advancement
